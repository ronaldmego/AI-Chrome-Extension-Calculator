# Simple Calculator Chrome Extension

## Finding the Extension ID

### For End-Users
To find the ID of the Simple Calculator Chrome Extension after it has been installed:
1. Open your Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Ensure that "Developer mode" is enabled in the top-right corner.
3. Locate the Simple Calculator Chrome Extension in the list of installed extensions.
4. The ID of the extension will be displayed beneath its name.

This ID is unique to the extension and can be used for referencing the extension or for support purposes.

### For Developers
During development, you might need to reference the extension's ID for various purposes, such as debugging or configuring extension-specific settings. To find the extension's ID during development:
1. Load the unpacked extension into Chrome by navigating to `chrome://extensions/`, enabling "Developer mode", and clicking "Load unpacked". Select the extension's directory.
2. Once loaded, the extension will appear in the list of extensions on the `chrome://extensions/` page, with its ID displayed beneath its name.

Note: The ID is generated by Chrome and is based on the extension's public key. It is not set manually in the `manifest.json` file or any other part of the extension's codebase.

## Internal Reference ID
For internal documentation or reference purposes, we have assigned an internal ID to this project. This ID is for our use only and does not affect the extension's functionality or its ID within Chrome.

Internal Project ID: `SCCE-2023-001`

Please replace the placeholder with an actual ID that you wish to use for internal reference.

Remember, this internal ID is just for documentation and internal reference and does not replace or affect the Chrome-generated extension ID.

## Logging and Error Handling
Throughout the development of this extension, logging and error handling have been implemented to ensure smooth operation and to aid in debugging. Developers are encouraged to review the console output during testing for insights into the extension's behavior and to identify any potential issues.

## Conclusion
This README provides guidance on how to find the extension's ID for both end-users and developers, and introduces an internal reference ID for documentation purposes. For further assistance or inquiries, please refer to the project's documentation or contact the development team.
